AI-BASED DERMATOLOGICAL DERMATOLOGICAL  DIAGNOSIS TOOL

OVERVIEW

This project addresses the challenge of limited access to dermatologists, especially in rural areas, by developing an AI-based tool for the preliminary diagnosis of skin diseases. Using advanced image processing techniques, this tool can quickly and accurately provide early diagnosis, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare disparities.

OBJECTIVE

Enhanced Diagnosis: Utilize EfficientNetB7 architecture and advanced image processing to improve the precision and speed of dermatological diagnoses.
Model Integration: Incorporate the trained model into healthcare systems to assist clinicians with real-time analysis, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and patient care.

KEY COMPONENT

EfficientNetB7 Architecture: Designed to handle high-resolution images and capture critical features for accurate diagnosis.
Dataset: Contains 3600 images (224x224) of benign and malignant moles, sourced from the ISIC Archive.
Neural Network: Includes convolutional layers, dense layers, batch normalization, and dropout regularization, optimized with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS   

Python 3.12: Used for its enhanced features and performance improvements.

VS Code: Preferred for its flexibility, efficiency, and extensive support for extensions and debugging.
